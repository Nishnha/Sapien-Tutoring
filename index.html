            <p>Hey Everyone! My name is Alice Zhou.  I am a senior at Chattahoochee High School.  A little bit about me first: I am a dedicated debater, an active member on student class council, and the co-president of our school’s joint middle and high school tutoring program.  I like working with children because they represent our society’s future! My strong suits are mostly within the maths or humanities, but I’m a straight A student overall.  I have taken numerous AP classes across all subject areas and scored exceptionally well on all of them. Furthermore, I have only taken both the ACT and SAT once and scored a 36 on the ACT and 800s on both the Reading and Math sections of the SAT; also, I’ve scored perfect or near perfect on multiple SAT II Subject Tests.  I was also went to Georgia Governor’s Honors Program for Social Studies my sophomore year. However, I personally think that scores do not really say much about who a person really is.  My definition of a successful student is one who develops a love for knowledge.  I am constantly motivated by my enthusiasm for learning.  I love to be challenged, and I am genuinely passionate about the subjects I study.  My passion for education has guided me to my extracurricular involvement in debate and tutoring where I get to see younger students realize their potential for growth! My hobbies include fencing, swimming, eating sushi, drinking bubble tea, and reading. I look forward to working with you and your child, and I hope I can do everything possible to unlock his or her true potential!</p>

            <p>Tutoring for much of his high school career, this dedicated, academically-outstanding student specializes in STEM—notably chemistry, physics and arithmetic—and Latin. Having worked as a teacher-assistant for chemistry, and with his years of general tutoring experience, Nish understands that students absorb information differently, and employs teaching styles that cater to each student's advantages.

            <p>Hello! My name is Akhil Hazari and I am a senior at Chattahoochee High School. From kindergarten to senior year, I have had a variety of teachers who used various methods to teach their students. An endless amount of worksheets, visual learning, hands on experiences, and lecturing are just a few of the ways I have been taught. From these experiences, I have learned one thing. Every student is unique and must be taught in a different way so they can fully understand the topic. Due to my diverse background I believe that I am capable of helping any student achieve their true potential. About my diverse background: I am on the varsity tennis team and enjoy playing all sports. I have been playing basketball, soccer, and football since the age of 6. In addition to my copious experience in sports, I enjoy caring for the environment. But what about my academic background? I will graduate this year with a total of 12 Advanced Placement classes and numerous honors and accelerated courses. Furthermore, I have scored a perfect 36 on the ACT science section and near perfect in the ACT reading and SAT Math section. My particular areas of expertise and enjoyment are science and math. I will be graduating with a total of 12 science and math classes (all honors or advanced placement). By using my diverse background and elevated academic knowledge, I will be able to help your student achieve his or her very best.</p>
